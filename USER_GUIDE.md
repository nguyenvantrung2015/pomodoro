## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into focused intervals:

```
Work 25 min → Break 5 min → Work 25 min → Break 5 min →
Work 25 min → Break 5 min → Work 25 min → Long Break 15 min
```

### Why It Works:
✅ **Prevents burnout** - Regular breaks maintain energy
✅ **Improves focus** - Time constraints boost concentration
✅ **Reduces distractions** - Clear work/break boundaries
✅ **Tracks progress** - See how many sessions you complete
✅ **Creates momentum** - Small wins build motivation

## Troubleshooting

### ❓ Common Issues

#### **"YouTube doesn't play automatically"**

**Cause:** Chrome's autoplay policy blocks videos on first use

**Solution:**
1. When break starts, click the YouTube tab once
2. Click play once manually
3. After this first interaction, autoplay works forever!

**Prevention:**
- Make sure you've clicked play on YouTube at least once before
- Chrome remembers and allows autoplay after first interaction

---

#### **"Music plays in foreground instead of background"**

**Solution:**
This shouldn't happen, but if it does:
1. Check that you're not clicking the YouTube tab
2. Extension should keep tab in background automatically
3. If still happening, report bug to developer

---

#### **"Timer stops when I close popup"**

**Answer:** This is normal!

**What's actually happening:**
- Timer continues running in background
- Click extension icon again to see current time
- You'll still get notifications when sessions end
- Music keeps playing

**Pro tip:**
Don't keep popup open. Click Start, then close popup. Extension works in background!

---

#### **"I missed clicking Start at exact time"**

**Solution:** It's okay!
- Pomodoro is flexible
- Start when ready, not when "perfect"
- Better to start late than not at all
- Consistency > perfection

---

#### **"I keep getting distracted during sessions"**

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce session length** - Try 15 minutes instead of 25
2. **Eliminate distractions** - Close tabs, silence phone
3. **Use focus music** - Helps block external noise
4. **Tell others** - "I'm in a Pomodoro, talk in 20 minutes"
5. **Write distractions down** - Keep notepad for "handle later" items

**Advanced Technique:**
If distracted, write it down on paper and tell yourself "I'll handle this during the next break." Usually the urge passes.

---

#### **"Break music is too loud/quiet"**

**Solution:**
1. YouTube volume is controlled by YouTube tab
2. Click YouTube tab during break
3. Adjust volume slider
4. Volume persists for future sessions

**Pro tip:**
Set volume during first break, it remembers!

---

#### **"Day Start didn't trigger this morning"**

**Checklist:**
- ✅ Is "Enable Day Start Session" toggled ON?
- ✅ Is Chrome open? (Must be running)
- ✅ Did you save settings?
- ✅ Is YouTube URL valid?
- ✅ Is time set correctly? (24-hour format: 05:00 not 5:00 PM)

**How to test:**
Set time to 2 minutes from now, wait and see if it triggers.
